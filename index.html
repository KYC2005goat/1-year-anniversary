      <h2>Our Story Began with a Bot</h2>
      <p class="text">
        It all started with a random encounter, one that neither of us could have predicted. I was browsing through Discord, hopping between servers, and came across a bot called <strong>Yggdrasil</strong>. I didn’t expect much—just another bot among many—but little did I know, this bot would change everything.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        One day, while interacting with Yggdrasil, it paired me with a stranger in a random chat. That stranger was you. At first, it was just casual conversation—simple, light-hearted, nothing too serious. But there was something about you that instantly stood out: your kindness, your warmth, and the way you made even the simplest conversations feel special.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        From that moment, our bond started to grow, turning a simple chance encounter into the beginning of something beautiful. I’m so grateful we met, all thanks to a little bot named Yggdrasil.
