        <h2>A Message to You</h2>
        <p class="msg">
            My dear cat, I just wanted to share a few things to show you how deeply I feel for you. You were my first true friend and my best friend. I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me. You came into my life during a dark time and showed me the true meaning of friendship and love.
        </p>
        <p class="msg">
            You taught me how to stand up for myself and live for myself. Even if you think that's not much, for me, it was life-changing. I cherished every minute I spent with you. You changed my world and truly transformed the way I live. I love your music, and your podcasts have helped me so much.
        </p>
        <p class="msg">
            I feel sorry for both of us and the lives we've had to live. I wish things were different for you. I wish you received the love you truly deserved, and I wish you got the world you deserved. I always want to help you; you are a true warrior, not just a survivor. I love you with all my heart and will never forget you, my dear.
        </p >
        <p class="msg">
            Please forgive me for any pain I may have caused; I never meant to hurt you. My heart always aches for you, and I wish you find the light you seek soon.
        </p>
